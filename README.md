# Graficos/Graphs

Here are all the results about my studing about doing graphs with the help of python.
I personally find it interesting due to past experiences where in my workplace we had a few problems regarding data viz software. 

It's good to have a few cards up your sleave.

As follows are some of the results I achieved learning with the wonderful work of Yan Holtz (https://python-graph-gallery.com/) and Matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/)
